# STATS220 2024

## About me
*Hi Everyone! I am in my final year at The University of Auckland studying towards a Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) degree, majoring in Statistics.*

You can learn more about me through my [Linkedn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheng-ya-wang-3007181a7/) page

## Purpose of the Repo
This repo will exhibit my submission of assignments in STATS 220. The projects will recognise the skills I attained from the course, covering the following reasons why I took STATS 220:

* Learn more about the world of data science
* Implement techniques used in data science for importing, analysing and visualising data for decision-making
* Learn about CSS and HTML to broaden my coding skills
* Think creatively with data technologies

There will be five projects across this course to demonstrate understanding in five modules:

1. Creating HTML by combining modern technologies
2. Creating web-based dynamic reporting systems
3. Creating new variables and data structures
4. Creating visual-based communications
5. Creating data from digital sources

**Thank you for being a part of my journey in discovering data science. [I love statistics!](https://swan683.github.io/stats220/)**
